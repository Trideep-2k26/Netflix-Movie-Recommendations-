# Netflix Movie Recommendation System

This is a **Netflix Movie Recommendation System** built using Python and Streamlit. The app recommends movies based on selected genres from Netflix's movie dataset. The project includes a visually enhanced user interface that features the Netflix logo and a button to visit Netflix's website.

## Features

- **Genre-based Recommendations**: Users can select a genre from the dropdown menu, and the app will display movie recommendations from Netflix.
- **Netflix-Style Button**: A button styled in Netflix's signature colors that redirects users to the Netflix homepage.
- **Custom UI Styling**: The interface includes modern and clean styling with custom fonts and colors for a sleek user experience.
- **Movie Information**: Each recommendation provides movie details such as the title, release year, rating, and a brief description.
- **Netflix Logo**: Displays the Netflix logo alongside the "Visit Netflix" button.
